# Data Structures and Algorithms Playground

## Overview
This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with basic data structures, solving unique problems, and showcasing a project.

## Contents

### 1. Data Structures
   - **LinkedList.cpp**: Implementation of a singly, doubly, ringed linked list in C++.
   - **Queue.cpp**: Implementation of a queue data structure using linked lists in C++.
   - **Stack.cpp**: Implementation of a stack data structure using arrays in C++.
   - **BinarySearchTree.cpp**: Implementation of a binary search tree in C++.
   - **BinaryThreadedTree.cpp**: Implementation of a binary search tree in C++.
   - **Heap.cpp**: Implementation of a binary search tree in C++.

### 2. Project
   - **Project**: Contains the source code for a project named "trainprob". This project demonstrates the practical application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world scenario.

### 3. Unique Problems
   - **josephusproblem.cpp**: Solution to a unique problem involving a specific algorithmic challenge.
   - **zigzag.py**: Solution to another unique problem showcasing a different algorithmic approach.
